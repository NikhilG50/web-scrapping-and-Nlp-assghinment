“We’ve had answers for every allegation that has been brought forward,” Gloria said at a news conference Monday. He said his office had responded publicly and forwarded information to the secretary of state for investigation. “If there’s anything that’s been done illegally, unfortunately, we’re going to find it,” he said.

The Trump campaign and Republicans have sued unsuccessfully in state and federal courts seeking changes to ballot-counting in Clark County. Now, they are arguing on social media and at protests that voting there has been riddled with fraud. At a news conference Sunday, Trump supporters gathered to hear Matt Schlapp of the American Conservative Union claim, “thousands of examples of voter irregularities,” an evidence-free claim.

The campaign has not submitted a formal complaint to Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford (D), nor has it filed any new evidence in court. Ford tweeted about the allegations, saying his office had been flooded with questions about complaints that had not been filed with his office. “PR doesn’t cut it,” he tweeted. “File an official complaint.”

Last week, the Trump campaign sent to the Justice Department a list of more than 3,000 voters who it claimed had voted illegally after moving out of state. Many of those voters had moved to addresses that were obviously for military installations both domestic and abroad, and military service members — as well as college students — may legally vote in Nevada even after moving elsewhere.

At Sunday’s news conference, campaign allies claimed that the number of illegal votes from nonresidents had climbed to 9,000. They also referred to an unnamed whistleblower who purportedly worked on ballot-counting for Clark County and allegedly saw a Biden-Harris van at a polling place in Clark County. Schlapp said that the van’s doors were open and that the person claims to have seen ballots “opened with letter openers, and ballots were filled in and resealed in envelopes.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PW74DTPXMRC6LKGNN5ZSFCC4EE.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/11/09/biden-trump-election-live-updates/,2020-11-09
